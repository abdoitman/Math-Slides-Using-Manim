# Math Slides Using Manim
Used [Manim](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) to create animated sequences of some mathematical equations to demonstrate them in a better way.


**NOTE**: To construct any scene in manim, define a class with the animation name, then define the animation sequence in the `construct(self)` method. <br>
To render the created scene run:
```console
manim -p animation.py [Scene_name]
```

Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/abdoitman/Math-Slides-Using-Manim/tree/main/media/videos/animation/1080p60).
